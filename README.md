# Weather_app

This repo consists of a weather application with an interface designed to be user friendly and current weather data fetched from an online API source.

The app's main goal is to provide users with up-to-date and accurate weather information through an easy-to-navigate interface. By incorporating API integration, it allows real-time weather data retrieval, enabling users to stay informed about weather conditions.

At the moment, the app only provides information about London, offering a brief summary about the current weather conditions and changing the background image to a photo depicting the current weather.

Currently, I'm working on adding a section where the user can input their own location and receive weather information based on this location. I'm also hoping to add in extra details about the weather such as the temperature and wind direction/speed.
