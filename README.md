# Weather_app

This project began during week 3 of my School of Code journey when myself and my team were asked to develop a weather app. I decided to continue to develop this project in order to hone my skills in front-end foundations.

This weather app's main goal is to provide users with up-to-date and accurate weather information through a user-friendly, easy-to-navigate interface. By incorporating API integration, it allows real-time weather data retrieval, enabling users to stay informed about weather conditions.

Current Status:

At the moment, the app provides information about a user-inputted location, offering a brief summary about the current weather conditions and changing the background image to a photo depicting the current weather.

Future plans:

- I'm hoping to add extra details about the weather and refine the user experience.
